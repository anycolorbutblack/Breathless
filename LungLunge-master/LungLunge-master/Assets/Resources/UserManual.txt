The goal of the game is to get to the end of the level in as quick as time as possible.

The controls to do so are;
JUMP : SPACE BAR
MOVING RIGHT : RIGHT ARROW  OR D
MOVING LEFT : LEFT ARROW  OR A
MENU : ESCAPE 
USE PUFFER ON SELF : CTRL OR LEFT-CLICK
USE PUFFER ON OBSTACLE : ALT OR RIGHT-CLICK

There are obstacles that will appear and the goal is to avoid, otherwise you will be slowed down.
Jumping is the best way to avoid the obstacles.
Another option is to destroy the enemy by using the PUFFER ON OBSTACLE.
Once you run out of the puffer charge you will not be able to recover breath unless you stop.
The puffer charge is the resource used for PUFFER ON OBSTACLE.
You may recover breath by using the puffer on self. 

There are objects throughout the game that can add a charge to your puffer.
This is the only to regain it.
